Hi! I'm Victor Gerardo Rivera, an AI Engineer and Data Scientist with expertise in designing and deploying scalable machine learning solutions. With a strong foundation in Data Science and AI Engineering, I specialize in leveraging advanced analytics, deep learning, and cloud computing to drive business impact.

I have hands-on experience with Python (Pandas, NumPy, Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow), SQL & NoSQL databases, and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure). My skill set includes MLOps (Docker, Kubernetes, Airflow), Big Data processing (Spark, Databricks), and data visualization (Power BI, Tableau). I excel in Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and recommendation systems, applying AI to real-world business challenges.

With a background in Software Engineering and Business Management, I bridge the gap between technical development and strategic decision-making. I am passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights, optimizing AI workflows, and staying at the forefront of technological advancements.
